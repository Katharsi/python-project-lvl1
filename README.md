**Brain Games** *is a series of five mini-games that allows you to train your brain based on mathematical expressions.*

*__Get start and do this:__*

- _Parity check_ *`brain-even`*
- _Simple calculator_ *`brain-calc`*
- _Greatest common division_ *`brain-gcd`*
- _Arithmetic progression_ *`brain-progression`*
- _Prime number_ *`brain-prime`*

___

1. ***Brain-even***

>A random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

- *Run brain-even*
- *Welcome moment: write your name and we will definitely greet you*
- *Get a question from us and give an answer to it*
- *If you answer correctly, the game continues. Only 3 rounds</br>At the end of the game we will definitely congratulate you*
- *If you answer incorrectly, then don't worry. After all, the game can be started again*
- ***Good luck!***
___

2. ***Brain-calc***

>The user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

- *Run brain-calc*
- *Welcome moment: write your name and we will definitely greet you*
- *Get a question from us and give an answer to it*
- *If you answer correctly, the game continues. Only 3 rounds</br>At the end of the game we will definitely congratulate you*
- *If you answer incorrectly, then don't worry. After all, the game can be started again*
- ***Good luck!***
___

3. ***Brain-gcd***

>The user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

- *Run brain-gcd*
- *Welcome moment: write your name and we will definitely greet you*
- *Get a question from us and give an answer to it*
- *If you answer correctly, the game continues. Only 3 rounds</br>At the end of the game we will definitely congratulate you*
- *If you answer incorrectly, then don't worry. After all, the game can be started again*
- ***Good luck!***
___

4. ***Brain-progression***

>We show the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression by replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

- *Run brain-progression*
- *Welcome moment: write your name and we will definitely greet you*
- *Get a question from us and give an answer to it*
- *If you answer correctly, the game continues. Only 3 rounds</br>At the end of the game we will definitely congratulate you*
- *If you answer incorrectly, then don't worry. After all, the game can be started again*
- ***Good luck!***
___

5. ***Brain-prime***

>Is it a prime number?

- *Run brain-prime*
- *Welcome moment: write your name and we will definitely greet you*
- *Get a question from us and give an answer to it*
- *If you answer correctly, the game continues. Only 3 rounds</br>At the end of the game we will definitely congratulate you*
